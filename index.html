      <h2>General Rules</h2>
      <p>• Using cheats or disruptive in-game exploits is strictly prohibited.</p>
      <p>• NO SOUNDBOARDS IN RP. The only exception is a hoster gives permission, in which case the soundboard must make
        sense. Soundboards should be kept to a minimum outside of RP as well.</p>
      <p>• Racism, homophobia, or any sort of hateful language is strictly prohibited.</p>
      <p>• Stay in character as much as possible, and notify others when you are not. If you have no intent to roleplay,
        this is not the server for you.</p>
      <p>• Be respectful out of character, only be rude in character if the situation calls for it.</p>
      <p>• Remember to FEARRP; Value your life and be afraid of your character's death!</p>
      <p>• Do not mention OOC (Out of Character) knowledge! If your character wouldn't know something, then you
        shouldn't be acting like you do. When you die, you are a new character, so don't mention your past lives.</p>
      <p>• Obey chain of command! Blatant disobedience when in threat of harm or punishment is unrealistic. If following
        orders requires you to break the rules, the person who ordered you will be punished.</p>
      <p>• Follow the guidelines and rules for your specific role listed below. These may be ignored if you have a good
        enough reason and roleplay it well.</p>
      <p>• Harassing hosters or other players, or generally being a nuisance to the server will result in punishment.

    <section id="roles" class="roles">
      <h1>Human Roles</h1>
      <h2>Mobile Task Force Members:</h2>
      <p>• Do not need to openly FearRP, but must still value their lives.</p>
      <p>• Take a SLOW AND STEADY approach to clearing out the facility. DO NOT RUN STRAIGHT INTO DANGER LIKE AN IDIOT,
        PLAY AS A SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIER WOULD AND CLEAR ROOMS BIT BY BIT.</p>
      <p>• Must NEVER use any SCP items. No matter the situation, unless cleared by the Main Hoster.</p>
      <p>• Must not waste ammunition by graffitiing walls or shooting into the ceiling/sky.</p>
      <p>• May kill uncuffed and alone Class-D on sight, armed or not. Note: this may result in the death of a Janitor,
        which will not fall onto the fault of the MTF who killed them as chances are not to be taken. If a Janitor wants
        to survive they should stick by other personnel.</p>
      <p>• Must not engage in conversation with researchers or other personnel that are not part of security. They must
        always prioritize their task first, even if that means giving people the cold shoulder.</p>
      <p>• Are to call out usage of a grenade before throwing one.</p>
      <p>• Are not to Terminate SCPs unless they have full knowledge of a greenlight in place.</p>
      <p>• Must never endanger research personnel. This includes shooting past them down a hall, aiming at them, or
        shooting through them to kill someone/something else.</p>
      <p>NOTE: Act professionally. Do not rush forward all gun-ho like there won't be any consequences and keep it
        quiet. Split off into small groups and clear rooms while slow-walking. Encourage others to do the same. Play it
        like a Mil-Sim.</p>
      <p>NOTE 2: More 'elite' Mobile Task Force units (i.e Red Right Hand) may have termination rights for even the
        smallest discrepancies researchers or Security personnel may make, such as approaching when warned not to near
        them. Obviously, do not abuse these rights, you can be reported if it's unfair TK.</p>
      <h2>Chaos Insurgency Members:</h2>
      <p>• Kill all foundation personnel on sight, including Class-D (if they feel that it is necessary).</p>
      <p>• Are to avoid surrender and mostly die for their cause.</p>
      <p>• Abuse and destroy as much of the foundation as possible.</p>
      <p>• Not be allowed to team kill.</p>
      <p>NOTE: The CI aren't required to clear out rooms slowly and tactically but it is still heavily suggested. CI are
        still special forces, but it is not required.</p>
      <h2>Research Personnel:</h2>
      <p>• Should at all times practice FearRP (be realistically afraid for your life). Failure to do this will most
        likely result a FailRP offense.</p>
      <p>• Are required to listen to Senior Researchers/Supervisors no matter what. If you feel that their order was
        against RP or under FailRP rules, report them.</p>
      <p>• In need of Class-D for a test, are to request a guard to verify and accompany you. That being said, DO NOT
        TAKE CLASS-D FROM THEIR CELLS WITHOUT GUARDS PRESENT.</p>
      <p>• Are NOT to carry any sort of firearm without a gun license. Doing so will result in arrest and the revoking
        of your security clearance card for a time.</p>
      <p>• Are NOT to pick up guns during a breach and attempt to help Mobile Task Force or guards. The main priority of
        all researchers is to escape the facility/hide from threats.</p>
      <p>• Are NOT to loot emergency medical supply boxes found on walls or any of the lockers. You should treat those
        static objects with real-world value.</p>
      <p>NOTE: Foundation personnel may not act as undercover CI spies unless given express permission by the Main
        Hoster.</p>
      <h2>Class-D Personnel:</h2>
      <p>• Should at all times practice FearRP (be realistically afraid for your life). Failure to do this will most
        likely result a FailRP offense.</p>
      <p>• Most likely, a Class-D won't know anything about the facility prior to the round, so please do not meta-game
        and act like you know everything about the facility. However, if you RP that you are an experienced class-d who
        has been around for awhile, you may bypass this rule depending on how well you RP it.</p>
      <p>• Do not constantly yell or scream from within your cell. It is annoying for the people around you and can be
        counted as mic spam. No more "let me out! Let me out!" please.</p>
      <p>• Do not listen to a Researcher/Scientist unless permitted to by a guard. i.e: A Scientist opens up your cell
        door and asks you to step out, with no guard present or no guard allowing it.</p>
      <p>• Do not purposefully be a nuisance and only act realistically in a situation. This means door cheesing out of
        a cell when told to get in. If you are acting out enough with behavior such as that or Bunny Hopping around a
        bunch then you can be reported for FailRP.</p>
      <p>NOTE: Class-D May be shot on sight ONLY BY MOBILE TASK FORCE If undetained. Even if you have no gun, not being
        near facility personnel is a risk you take during a breach of security.</p>
      <h2>Security Personnel:</h2>
      <p>• Are to practice some FearRP. You were trained highly for your position at the SCP Foundation but you can
        still be frightened.</p>
      <p>• Are NOT to shoot walls and waste ammo. With this, graffitiing walls pre-round or during rp will result in a
        ban.</p>
      <p>• Are to terminate Class-D on sight ONLY when in threat of danger from a confirmed to be armed Class-D.</p>
      <p>• Are to warn any personnel at risk of termination, clearly and at least twice, before terminating the subject.
      </p>
      <p>• Are to ask All researchers that have been seen brandishing a weapon if they have a gun license. If not, they
        are to hand over their weapon. If the researcher does have a gun license, the guard must relay the name of the
        researcher and confirm their license on the radio.</p>
      <p>• Must not let researchers enter CDC (Class-D Cells) without permission.</p>
      <p>• Are NOT to crowd testing procedures. Went to a test you really wanted to be present at but there were too
        many guards there already? Too bad! Be the bigger man and go on patrol elsewhere.</p>
      <p>• Are to stay at their assigned post no matter what, unless a serious situation needs assistance and no one
        else can assist.</p>
      <p>• Must never aim or antagonize any Facility Personnel.</p>
      <p>• Must NEVER misuse flash grenades, doing so will result in an immediate ban. Also, always call out that you
        will be throwing one to your teammates, or in more stealthy situations, ensure that surrounding teammates know
        before its thrown.</p>
      <p>NOTE: It goes without saying that all guards must obey the orders of higher ranking personnel. If you feel that
        they have made an unjust order that goes against RP, report them.</p>
